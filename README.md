### Introduction

Retirement for Millennials ?

According to a 2022 report by HealthView Services, almost half Millennials expressed a level of agreement on the fact that they wonâ€™t get Social Security benefits. Understanding financial literacy and proactively taking steps is crucial for Millennials to prepare for a future where Social Security might not be a guaranteed source of retirement income.

Here are a few facts by Investopedia survey

"[...] 74% said they are at least somewhat stressed about managing their finances."

There are plenty of investing options, but for one of the main indexes in America, is the S&P500, which is componed by top 500 publicly traded companies.
According to Investopedia, from 1957 to 2023 the S&P500 has had an average return of 10.26%.

### Analysis
What is an ETF?
An ETF is a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds, managed by experts, in a single fund that trades on major stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and Chicago Board Options Exchange. (Vanguard)

### Recommendations
After collecting some facts, we recommend Millenials do their own due diligence and get educated on Individual Retirement Account (IRA) types and also perform research on the types of exchange-traded fund (ETFs) that are available for investment in the IRA
