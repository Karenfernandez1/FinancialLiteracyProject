### Introduction

Will Millennials be able to enjoy a comfortable retirement?

According to a 2022 report by HealthView Services, almost half Millennials expressed a level of agreement on the fact that they won’t get Social Security benefits. Understanding financial literacy and proactively taking steps is crucial for Millennials to prepare for a future where Social Security might not be a guaranteed source of retirement income.

"[...] 74% [millennials] said they are at least somewhat stressed about managing their finances."

Retirement doesn't have to depend solely on Social Security, especially considering that financial education is a personal responsibility. Consequently, we can explore alternative tools for long-term investment that contribute to our retirement plans. To keep things straightforward, our focus will be exclusively on investing in an S&P 500 ETF.

### Analysis

#### What is an ETF?
An ETF is a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds, managed by experts, in a single fund that trades on major stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and Chicago Board Options Exchange (Vanguard). You can think of it as a basquet of stocks.

There are plenty of types of ETFs, such as equity, bond, commodities, sector ETFs, etc.

For this analysis, our focus will be on S&P 500 ETFs, representing a pivotal American index composed of the top 500 publicly traded companies. According to Investopedia's report covering the years from 1957 to 2023, the S&P 500 has showcased a commendable average return of 10.26%.

It is crucial to acknowledge that the ROI varies, as this percentage has fluctuated in certain years as shown on the graph below:

#### The Power of Compound Interest

“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it... he who doesn't... pays it.” ― Albert Einstein.

Compound interest is akin to a snowball that, once formed, can only grow bigger and bigger. The Merriam-Webster website defines it as "noun: interest computed on the sum of an original principal and accrued interest," essentially, interest on interest.

#### Compound Interest Magic: A $10,000 Investment Journey

As an illustration, let's contemplate a $10,000 investment made in 1992 without any additional contributions. If we had purchased the S&P 500 and held onto it until 2022, that initial $10,000 would have grown to approximately $170,475. This remarkable growth is attributed to the power of compound interest.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1705699694060' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='$10K Invested into the S&amp;P 500 from 1992 to 2022 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;10&#47;10KInvestmentSP500&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='10KInvestmentSP500&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;10&#47;10KInvestmentSP500&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>          


Now, let's consider an annual contribution of $6,000 into the same S&P 500 ETF, assuming it has an average return of 10.26%. With this amount added every year, coupled with the power of compound interest, we could amass over a million dollars in 30 years.
